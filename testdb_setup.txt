1. Install PostgreSQL
	sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
2. This installation will add a Linux user called 'postgres'. Change its password to the same password for the VM
	sudo passwd postgres
3. Now change the password for the postgres database user (separate from the postgres Linux user). Use the same password as for the VM
	su - postgres
	psql -d template1 -c "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword';"
4. While you are still logged in as the postgres user (with su - postgres), create the test database
	createdb placenames-udb
5. Make sure you can connect to it. Enter /q to quit the Postgres console
	psql placenames-udb
6. The end. You'll only be able to connect to the database from your postgres Linux user unless you set up other stuff
